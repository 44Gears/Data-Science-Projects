About me

I am a former professional photographer currently making a transition into the exciting world of data science. The path I took to get here has definitely been a crooked one but I have picked up valuables lessons along the way. I have always been the builder type and wanted to make things that are unique, which somehow led me to art school. I received my photography education from Otis College of Art and Design and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1999. This led to working on many cool film and tv projects during the early 2000s, which was a goal of mine since I was a kid. I had some great memories working in that industry but also had a fascination with the business world. Uh oh, here comes the sharp curve on my path!

With an interest in business and sales, I decided to get my California real estate and insurance licenses (currently expired) and work in 
real estate/insurance sales..... and FAILED SPECTACULARLY. But while doing this, I wanted to get online exposure, which led me to learning how to build web sites and SEO. This is where the road turned the other way towards the tech side. Also, after learning I am an INTP, it all made sense. One of the big lessons learned.  

After searching for other ways to incorporate my creative side with technology, I happened to stumble upon the field of data science and immediately took an interest in learning it. In January 2017, I began learning data science through the online platform Dataquest.io. Then later that year, I enrolled in UC Irvine's Certificate in Data Science program. Throughout the 2017 year, I've learned data analysis in Python, statistical analysis using Tibco Statistica software, data mining applications, data visualization using Tableau, and Java programming. In September 2018, I graduated from UC Irvine with a Certificate in Data Science. I learned a lot but just scratched the surface, with much more learning to do.

Looking back on this journey, I realized that going from photography into data science was not as far-fetched as I thought and I ended up coming back full circle. Both are a mix of art and science. 

When I'm not sitting in front of a Jupyter Notebook jotting down code, you can find me walking my Boxer at the beach, ocean paddling, or enjoying a delicious craft brew from one of the many local breweries around the South Bay in Los Angeles, CA.
