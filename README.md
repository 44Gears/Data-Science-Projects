About me

I am a former professional photographer currently making a transition into the world of data science. In Sept. 2018, I graduated from UC Irvine with a Certificate in Data Science. I received my BFA in photography from Otis College of Art and Design in 1999 before embarking on a career as a photographer and working in the film industry.

With an interest in business, I also received my California real estate and insurance licenses (currently expired) and work in the commercial real estate industry as an office administrator and previously a property coordinator. I am also self-taught in minor web site development and search engine optimization to create affiliate marketing web sites.

After searching for other ways to incorporate my creative side with technology, I happened to stumble upon the field of data science and immediately took an interest in learning it. In January 2017, I began learning data science through the online platform Dataquest.io. Then later that year, I enrolled in UC Irvine's Certificate in Data Science program. Throughout the 2017 year, I've learned data analysis in Python, statistical analysis using Tibco Statistica software, data mining applications, data visualization using Tableau, and Java programming.

When I'm not sitting in front of a Jupyter Notebook or Eclipse jotting down code, you can find me walking my Boxer at the beach, ocean paddling, or enjoying a delicious craft brew from one of the many local breweries around the South Bay in Los Angeles, CA.
