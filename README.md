About me

I love to problem solve and dig deep into analysis to investigate the issue on hand. This enthusiasm led me to the UC Irvine Data Science program. The curriculum included data visualization, data warehousing, statistics and pre-calculus, predictive analytics, and Java. My favorite was predictive analytics and visualization. I recently graduated from the UCI Data Science program and seeking to use what I have learned. I am continuing my education through Dataquest.io to improve my data science skills using data analytic and programming tools including Python, Knime, Tableau, and Java programming.

I am excited to move onto a new path where I can utilize and grow my newfound skills with a team of problem solvers and analytic geeks like myself.
