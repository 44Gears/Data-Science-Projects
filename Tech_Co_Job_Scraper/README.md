This is a website scraper I built to scrape job search results from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Netflix. It takes a little over 4 hours to scrape all the jobs from all the websites but it works without crashing, at least at the time of this entry.

To run it, you'll need to have all files in one folder and run the 'scraper_main.py' file. It will create separate .csv files for each company but also one large .csv file with all jobs included.
